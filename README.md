# Description

Designed to be a one-size-fits-all application for local and new businesses who are yet to establish a web presence, or for those who wish to polish the appearance of their existing website.

This site is filled with some data about a fictitious local business, Cosmetiqua Tattooing, to showcase how information might be displayed.

Because the site is built with React and is component-based, it is relatively easy to add new pages and content as needed, and tailor it to each individual business.

There is a 'make a booking' page that integrates Calendly, an interactive calendar that can be linked to the business owner's email address and syncs with their existing calendar. This enables customers to make a booking directly without having to call or email the business, or to even have to wait for a confirmation that the business does indeed have a spare booking. The business owner can simply block out time that they don't wish to have appointments.

Suggested use cases for this site would be businesses such as local dentists, doctors and physios, salons, restaurants and any other business that would require a booking feature (which of course can be removed if necessary).
